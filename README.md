# EEG-emotion--AUDIO-BOT
MSSEC FRAMEWORK 
This project presents an advanced EEG-based emotion recognition system built upon the MSSEC framework, designed to process raw EEG signals into meaningful emotion classifications. The pipeline integrates multiple stages: M for MSPCA (Multiscale Principal Component Analysis) to denoise EEG signals across various scales, S for SODP (Second Order Difference Plot) to extract dynamic temporal patterns, and another S for SDC (Summation of Distance of Coordinates), which quantifies signal spread in the projected space to highlight structural differences in brain activity.

Next, E stands for EAP (Equidistant Azimuthal Projection), which spatially maps EEG features onto a 2D grid preserving electrode topology, enabling image-like analysis. Finally, C represents CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), which applies spatial and channel-wise attention to emphasize emotionally relevant patterns in the data. Together, MSSEC forms a robust end-to-end pipeline for decoding emotional states from EEG data, with potential applications in affective computing, brain-computer interfaces, and mental health monitoring.
